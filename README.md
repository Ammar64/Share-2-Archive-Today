# Share 2 Archive Today
 Simple Android app to add an icon to your share menu to archive a url on Archive.today and Archive.Is

This app is barebones basic, ~5 lines of code and does not spy on you or collect any data.
Also, in order for this app to be listed on the google play store, I have to reference the [privacy polcy](https://github.com/gabefair/Share-2-Archive-Today/blob/main/privacy.policy).

App is currently in Closed Beta testing and I'm looking for testers ( I have 15 so far and need 20 to be allowed onto the app store)
